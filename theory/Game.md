## Mathematical Representation of the Game

1. **State and Observation:**

   - **State Space.**  
     Define the game’s state as a point on a bounded two-dimensional integer grid:  
     \[
     s = (x, y) \quad \text{with} \quad x, y \in \mathbb{Z} \quad \text{and} \quad |x|, |y| \leq 10.
     \]
     
   - **Target.**  
     The target state is fixed at the origin:
     \[
     s_{\text{target}} = (0, 0).
     \]
     
   - **Observation Function.**  
     At any given state \( s = (x, y) \), the observation (input) is derived from the sign of each coordinate. Define a function
     \[
     I(z) =
     \begin{cases}
     0, & \text{if } z < 0, \\
     1, & \text{if } z \ge 0,
     \end{cases}
     \]
     so that the observation is:
     \[
     o = f(s) = \big(I(x),\, I(y)\big) \in \{00,\,01,\,10,\,11\}.
     \]
     (For example, if \( x < 0 \) and \( y \ge 0 \) the observation is "10".)

2. **Actions and State Transition:**

   - **Action Space.**  
     The available actions are given by a 2‑bit string that maps deterministically to one of four diagonal moves:
     
     | Action (2-bit) | Move Vector \( d \) |
     |---------------:|---------------------|
     |       **"00"** | \( (+1, +1) \)      |
     |       **"01"** | \( (+1, -1) \)      |
     |       **"10"** | \( (-1, +1) \)      |
     |       **"11"** | \( (-1, -1) \)      |

   - **Transition Rule.**  
     If the current state is \( s = (x, y) \) and the chosen action is \( d \) (as above), then the next state is:
     \[
     s' = s + d.
     \]
     
3. **Terminal Conditions:**

   - **Win.**  
     The game is won when the Manhattan distance to the origin is small:
     \[
     |x| + |y| \leq 2.
     \]
     
   - **Loss.**  
     The game is lost if either the number of moves exceeds a given bound (e.g., 40 moves) or if the state leaves the board (i.e. \( |x| > 10 \) or \( |y| > 10 \)).
