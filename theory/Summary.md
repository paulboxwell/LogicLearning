## Summary and Comparison Context

Mathematically, the problem is a small discrete control task: a mapping \( F \) is chosen from a finite set of 256 possible functions (since there are 4 inputs and each maps into 4 possible outputs) such that the induced sequence \( s_{n+1} = s_n + T(F(f(s_n))) \) drives the state into the target region in as few moves as possible over repeated rounds. The learning algorithm here is essentially a **tabular hill-climbing scheme** on the space of mappings:

- **Reinforcement Step:** Successful rounds increase the “confidence” (score) in the outputs chosen for the visited observations.
- **Exploration/Adjustment Step:** Unsuccessful rounds trigger a local, cyclic adjustment to the mapping for the poorest-performing observation.
- **Local Search:** By updating only one mapping per round (the one with the lowest score among those encountered), the algorithm undertakes an incremental, local search over a space of 256 mappings. 

This simple algorithm can be compared with alternative strategies such as gradient descent in a parametrized policy function, Q-learning with explicit value updates, or even evolutionary search over the 256-dimensional space. Each alternative approach would have its own convergence properties and efficiency in reducing the number of rounds required to achieve mastery.
